Account creation
----------------
Login Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you open the application, you will be asked for a username and password. It will depend on how you use the application. If it is a mode (1) in which you are the only one to use the application, you can create an account or if it is a quick analysis, you can connect with the default account ``"username: admin"`` , ``"password: admin"``.
