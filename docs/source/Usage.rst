.. Note::

 **Mode 2** will be the subject of an implementation available very soon. The reason for this is the implementation of *SFTP* (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for file uploading.

If it is "Mode (1)" where you are the only one using the application, you can create an account or if it is a quick scan, you can connect with the default account ``"username: admin"`` , ``"password: admin"`` by clicking on the new project.
