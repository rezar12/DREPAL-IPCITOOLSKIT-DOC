Reference Indexed
==================

The indexing of host and pathogen references facilitates alignment. One advantage of DREPAL-IPCINGSTOOLSKIT is that when a reference is indexed, it is added to a table, avoiding the need to re-import a reference that is already present in the table.

To index a reference, select the name of the reference in the ``"selectbox"``, e.g. ``"Reference.fasta"``, then click on ``"index"`` to index it.
