Clinical Isolates (fastq,gz)
----------------------------
The clinical isolates represent the raw data in "fastq" or "fastq.gz" format, a compressed, Paired-End format.

.. note::
  file naming in DREPAL-IPCINGSTOOLSKIT is very important. The following nomenclature examples are taken into account:
  
  - ``"xxxxxxxx_R1.fastq"`` et  ``"xxxxxxxx_R2.fastq"``
  
  - ``"xxxxxxxx_1.fastq"`` et   ``"xxxxxxxx_2.fastq"``
  
  in *fastq.gz format.
