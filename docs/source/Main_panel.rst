Main Panel
==========

The main panel will allow you to carry out all your analyses according to the option you have chosen. Don't forget that the DREPAL-IPCINGSTOOLSKIT is a pipeline and that the output of the previous stages determines the rest of your analyses.
In DREPAL-IPCINGSTOOLSKIT there is an indicator which allows you to see if a task is being executed. This is the animation at the top right of your screen when an operation is launched.
