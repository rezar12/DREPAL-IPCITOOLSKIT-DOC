Host Substract
===============

Host subtraction is an operation that consists of removing the host part of our sequences so that mapping onto the pathogen sequence is more efficient.
Select your host and click on "Start".

.. Note::
  Above all, don't confuse references. If you have made a mistake (confusing the host with the pathogen). Start the process again by selecting the correct reference.
