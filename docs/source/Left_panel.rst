* **Donut diagram of free and used space**

This diagram gives you an overview of the available disk space on the server for your analyses, consult it after each analysis to establish efficient resource management.

Operations menu
----------------

In the menu you will find all possible operations (see table of available operations), from importing files to emptying the analysis directory.

   * - Description
     - In this section import raw sequences and references (host and pathogen.
     - In this section, view the quality of the reads and cut them if necessary.
     - Indexing host and pathogen references.
     - Remove the host's share of the reads.
     - Kept the corresponding share of pathogens in each reads.
     - It is optional to visualise the host, pathogen and other parts contained in each read.
     - This is the part of the analysis that consists of finding the mutations by using a number of technologies.
     - The Mutation Matrix (for SNPs) allows us to have an overview of the SNP type mutations for all reads in a spreadsheet facilitating a number of downstream   statistical analyses.
     - Used to assign functional information to mutations via Snpeff and SnpSift.
     - This section allows for the dumping of what appears to be the scan directory to save disk resources once the scan is complete or in the event of an error.
